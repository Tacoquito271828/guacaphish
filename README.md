# guacaphish
This repository contains the docker image working to steal the mfa of an account using the power of vnc

its supposed to be integrated with gophish, guacamole and custom scripts to dinamically run 5 instances of the images and start storing on each machine the diferent sessions gotten, right now it would need a lot of more fixes the avoid the dumb errors (like if the user puts the mouse on exact pixel can see that its in another Firefox)
